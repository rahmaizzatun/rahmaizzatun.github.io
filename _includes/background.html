      I’m a fresh <b>Accounting graduate</b> from Jenderal Soedirman University with a strong interest in how
      numbers reflect reality and how audits ensure accountability. During my internship at a public accounting
      firm, I assisted in external audits across various industries—supporting stock opname, reviewing financial
      statements, and tracing evidence to its source.

      From these experiences, I learned that <b>auditing</b> is both a responsibility and an art. Each audit tells
      a story not just of numbers, but of integrity, risk, and trust. I value the precision and critical thinking
      required in the process.

      Outside academics, I volunteer as a BIPA Assistant at the International Relations Office, helping international
      students adapt and learn Bahasa Indonesia. I enjoy cultural exchange and believe curiosity and open-mindedness
      are key to both personal and professional growth.
