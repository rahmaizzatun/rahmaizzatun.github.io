      I’m a fresh <b>Accounting graduate</b> from Jenderal Soedirman University with a deep curiosity for how 
      numbers reflect reality and how audits help keep that reality honest. During my internship at a 
      public accounting firm, I took part in external audits across different industries, assisting in 
      stock opname, examining financial statements, and tracing evidence to its source.

    <p>
      It was in those moments of comparing figures to facts and confirming the smallest details that I 
      discovered how <b>auditing</b> is both an art and a responsibility. I came to appreciate that every audit 
      tells a story not just about numbers but about integrity, risk, and trust.

    <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy meeting people from different countries and exchanging ideas. 
      I am currently volunteering at the International Relations Office as a BIPA Assistant, where 
      I serve as a cultural buddy. In this role, I help international students adapt to the local 
      environment and learn Bahasa Indonesia. I believe that staying curious and open-minded is essential 
      for both personal and professional growth.</p>
